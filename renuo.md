In 2013 I joined [Renuo](https://renuo.ch), as a Software Engineer.
Today I am a Partner of the company and I am working on different Ruby On Rails projects.

Renuo is an amazing place to work: we really strive to have a modern and healthy work culture, and the participation of each individsual
in the company is really important.

We are an on-site Web Agency, so please don't apply if you are looking for a remote job: you must be resident in Switzerland.

We are always open to spontaneous applications, so if you are a Ruby On Rails developer, feel free to write to us.
