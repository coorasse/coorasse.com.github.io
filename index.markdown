ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Blog. 

I' keep this website as simple as possible, with the goal of collecting content in a Git Repository as future reference.

I went through both medium.com and dev.to and finally decided to host the blog myself using Jekyll, PicoCSS and Github Pages.

If you like reading what I write, I guess the RSS Feed should do somehow.
