      ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Blog.<br>
      Here you find my writings and my projects. 
      I try to keep this website as simple as possible, with the goal of collecting and own my content.<br> 
      I went through both medium.com and dev.to and finally decided to host the blog myself using Jekyll, SimpleCSS and Github Pages.<br>
      If you like reading what I write, let me know.<br>
