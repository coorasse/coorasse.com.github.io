Around 2014, I started a project called [Agreeder](https://agreeder.com/).

Agreeder is the final chapter of my interest in voting theory, democracy, and politics.

The project uses [Schulze Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method) to aggregate votes from users and display the results in a user-friendly way.

If you want to know more, read about it on [Agreeder](https://agreeder.com/results-algorithm).

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions about the project.
