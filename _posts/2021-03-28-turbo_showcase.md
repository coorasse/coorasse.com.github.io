![Turbo Showcase demo](/assets/turbo_showcase/demo.gif)

I was getting a bit lost in the documentation of [Turbo](https://hotwire.dev/), so I thought "Why not creating a showcase of what you can actually do with it?"

So here it is: https://turbo-showcase.herokuapp.com/

Currently, we have some examples of Turbo Drive, Turbo Frame and Turbo Stream, and a first combination of what you can achieve with ViewComponent + Turbo + Stimulus.

The Application is fully inspectable and you can enjoy the beautiful Source Code directly in the Browser or on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/renuo/turbo-showcase).

Please feel free to contribute or make requests! At [Renuo](https://renuo.ch) we will keep adding more and more examples while exploring the possibilities of this new Framework.
