excerpt: "My new blog is ready and Jekyll is exactly what I needed!"

Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹,
This is my new blog / website / place where I dump my thoughts and ideas.

I own this domain since forever, but I never really used it. 

I started publiching on medium.com, but I was quickly annoyed by how bloated it became.

Looking for alternative, I discovered dev.to, which has been a great place to write for some time, but I was 
always disappointed by the editor and the User Experience.

So here is my new blog, and these were my constraints:
* It has to be simple. As simple as possible. 
* I want to own my content, so it should be in a git repository
* I want to use markdown
* I want to self-host it

I therefore decided to use Jekyll, because of the incredible simplicity it provides. 
I know there's way more modern tools out there, but I simply don't need them: I don't want to include React components, 
or do more complex things, so Jekyll is just enough.

Also, be able to work with ruby is a big plus for me, and I can use my existing knowledge to extend it if needed.

I also did not want to build from Sass, so I went with SimpleCSS, which is a very simple CSS framework that does not require any build step.
If you like my template, you can find it on [github](https://github.com/coorasse/jekyll-simplecss).

Last but not least, Github Pages is able to host Jekyll sites without any additional configuration, 
so I can just push my changes and have them online in a few seconds.

So far, I could do the whole setup and migration in a few hours, and I am very happy with the result.

I can definitely recommend Jekyll to anyone who wants to have a simple blog in 2025.
