My name is Alessandro Rodi. 
I work mostly as a Software Engineer at [Renuo](https://renuo.ch), where I am a co-owner.
As a side task, I also manage the company in a team of three.

I am a Ruby on Rails Engineer since 2010. You might spot me around at Ruby conferences, if so, come and say "hi". 
I am always happy to meet new people and Rails Engineers.  

I live in Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, just outside ZÃ¼rich, together with Martina, Lorenzo and Pietro.
